# Book Library

A web application that interacts with a MongoDB database using the MERN stack we have been covering in this module. The application has to implement the 4 CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete).

* Register: create, read, update or delete a profile with personal information, including a profile picture and password management (change, recovery) 
* Authentication: Log in and log out 
* Search: for books that match certain criteria (e.g. publication year, title or author containing a word) 
* View: View search results 
* Filter: The search results 
* Add books to a personal area (e.g. “My Books”) 
* Only logged in users can add books to the personal area 
* Any user can search for books and see the results.
* Include a README.md with comprehensive installation instructions for setting up and running the project
